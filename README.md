In the "Data Design and Representation" course this semester, I learned how to use Python for web scraping. 
The main method I learned was using BeautifulSoup, and besides that, I also learned how to utilize Selenium for automatic dynamic web scraping. 
For data storage, I established a connection between Python and MongoDB to store semi-structured data.
